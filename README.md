# 18-Months-Cloud-Migration-Project
Outline of a comprehensive project plan for migrating 50 on-premises applications to Azure over an 18-month period. 
This proposal includes project phases, task breakdowns, resource allocations, and risk management strategies.

# Project Structure

Discovery & Assessment (3 months)

  -   Application inventory and dependency mapping
- Workload assessment and prioritization
- Technical debt evaluation
- Cloud architecture design


Planning & Preparation (2 months)

- Migration strategy development (6R approach: Rehost, Refactor, Rearchitect, Rebuild, Replace, Retire)
- Azure environment setup
- Network connectivity establishment
- Security and compliance framework implementation


Pilot Migration (2 months)

- Migration of 3-5 non-critical applications
- Validation and testing procedures
- Performance baseline establishment
- Process refinement


Full-Scale Migration (9 months)

- Application migrations in prioritized waves
- Data migration and synchronization
- Integration testing
- Cutover planning and execution


Optimization & Closure (2 months)

- Performance tuning
- Cost optimization
- Knowledge transfer
- Project closure and lessons learned


## Task Dependencies
Key dependencies would include:
* Assessment completion before migration strategy finalization
* Azure environment setup before any migration activities
* Network connectivity establishment before application migrations
* Successful pilot migration before proceeding to full-scale migration
* Application migration completion before optimization

## Timeline & Scheduling
For the Gantt chart visualization, I would create a comprehensive timeline with realistic durations:
* **Discovery & Assessment**: Weeks 1-12
* **Planning & Preparation**: Weeks 13-20
* **Pilot Migration**: Weeks 21-28
* **Full-Scale Migration**: Weeks 29-64
* **Optimization & Closure**: Weeks 65-72

Key milestones would include:
* Assessment completion (Week 12)
* Azure environment readiness (Week 20)
* Pilot migration completion (Week 28)
* 25% applications migrated (Week 40)
* 50% applications migrated (Week 48)
* 75% applications migrated (Week 56)
* All applications migrated (Week 64)
* Project closure (Week 72)

## Additional Considerations
1. **Application Grouping Strategy**
   * Group applications by:
      * Business criticality (tier 1, 2, 3)
      * Technical complexity
      * Interdependencies
      * Business function

2. **Migration Approach**
   * Implement a wave-based approach:
      * Wave 1: Simple, non-critical applications (weeks 29-40)
      * Wave 2: Moderately complex applications (weeks 41-52)
      * Wave 3: Complex, critical applications (weeks 53-64)

3. **Testing Strategy**
   * Develop comprehensive testing procedures:
      * Unit testing
      * Integration testing
      * Performance testing
      * Security testing
      * User acceptance testing

## Assumptions
1. Current infrastructure is well-documented with existing application inventory
2. Stable network connectivity between on-premises and Azure is achievable
3. Business stakeholders are available for timely decision-making
4. Necessary budget is approved for Azure infrastructure and tools
5. The organization has basic cloud governance frameworks in place
